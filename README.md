# Project Microservices and Spring Boot 2

## Description
This project has been created with the purpose of learning how to create an API using Spring Boot.
In this project I created two services, one that returns a list of five artist given a term as parameter and 
another that returns a list of album given a artist' id as parameter.

## How to Use
You just have to enter inside the root repository and paste the following code in your terminal:

`mvn clean compile exec:java`
